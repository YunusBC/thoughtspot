## About the project

This react application is based on the first version of Thoughtspot Portal. 
You need to login to https://livingston.thoughtspot.cloud/ to display the embedded links
Added routing support for navigation. When you click an item on the menu, it doesn't reload the page.
Semantic-UI CDN is added to the project. You can remove it from index.html if you need to
Each menu item is a component, so has its own css file. Do the customizations there

PLEASE DON'T FOCUS ON THE DESIGN AT THE MOMENT !
